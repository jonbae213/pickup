Pickup is an app clone of Drop (formerly known as Massdrop), a group-buy website oriented around passions and community interaction. Built with a Rails/PSQL backend and React/Redux frontend, Pickup highlights some of Drop's key features like posting reviews, following communities/hobbies, and saving things/products to their profiles.
